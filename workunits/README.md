## Workunits
A workunit is a logical container holding a collection of fragments. These are
common collections used across multiple scenarios.

## Guidelines
- Place only frequently used collections in this folder.
- Structure them logically to enable easy navigation.
- Avoid cluttering by placing them in containers or sub-containers.
- Ensure a descriptive container name.
