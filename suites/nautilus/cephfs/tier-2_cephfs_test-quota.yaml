# Conf file : conf/nautilis/cephfs/tier_0_fs.yaml
# Test-Case Covered:
#	CEPH-83573399	Test to validate the quota.max_files  Create a FS and create 10 directories and
#                   mount them on kernel client and fuse client(5 mounts each)  Set max files quota to a number(say 50)
#                   add up to that number of files to that directory and  verify if the set quota limit is working fine.
#                   Similarly set different limit on different directories and  verify quota.
#   CEPH-83573400     Test to validate the increase in quota limit once it reaches the max limit. (files)
#                     Create a FS and create 10 directories and mount them on kernel client and fuse client(5 mounts
#                     each). Set max file quota to a number(say 50) and add up to that number of files to that directory
#                     and verify if the set quota limit is working fine.
#                     Increase the set quota limit to more that what was set
#                     earlier and add more files and verify.
#                     Similarly set different limit on different directories,increase
#                     the limit and verify it’s functionality and verify quota
#   CEPH-83573405     Test to validate the removal of quota_max_files
#                     Create a FS and create 10 directories and mount them on kernel client and fuse client
#                     Set max files quota to a number(say 50) and add up to that number of files to that directory and
#                     verify if the set quota limit is working fine. Remove the quota once it reaches the max number of
#                     files and try adding more files, verify if set quota is removed. Repeat the procedure for few more
#                     times.
#   CEPH-83573399     Test to validate the quota.max_files
#                     Create a FS and create 10 directories and mount them on kernel client and fuse client
#                     Set max files quota to a number(say 50) and add up to that number of files to that directory and
#                     verify if the set quota limit is working fine.
#                     Similarly set different limit on different directories and verify quota.
#   CEPH-83573401     Test to validate the increase in quota limit once it reaches the max limit. (bytes)
#                     Create a FS and create 10 directories and mount them on kernel client and fuse client(5 mounts
#                     each). Set max bytes quota to a number(say 1Gb) and fill data until it reaches the limit and
#                     verify if the set quota limit is working fine.
#                     Increase the set quota limit to more that what was set earlier and
#                     fill more data and verify. Similarly set different limit on different directories, increase
#                     the limit and verify it’s functionality and verify quota.
#   CEPH-83573407     Negative : Test to validate the decrease in quota limit once it reaches the max limit. (bytes)
#                     Create a FS and create 10 directories and mount them on kernel client and fuse client
#                     Set max bytes quota to a number(say 1Gb) and fill data until it reaches the limit and
#                     verify if the set quota limit is working fine.
#                     Try setting the quota limit to lesser than what was set
#                     earlier, setting quota lesser that the space occupied shouldn’t be allowed. Repeat the same
#                     procedures for 5-10 times.
#   CEPH-83573409     Test to validate the removal of quota_max_bytes
#                     Create a FS and create 10 directories and mount them on kernel client and fuse client
#                     Set max bytes quota to a number and fill data until it reaches the limit,verify if the set
#                     quota limit is working fine. Remove the quota once it reaches the max bytes and try adding more
#                     data, verify if set quota is removed. Repeat the procedure for few more times.
#   CEPH-83573408     Test to validate the quota remains intact even after rebooting the Node.
#                     Create a FS and create 10 directories and mount them on kernel client and fuse client(5 mounts
#                     each). Set max bytes quota to a number(say 1Gb) and also set max files quota and verify if
#                     the set quota limit is working fine by filling max number of files and also by filling data to reach
#                     the max limit. Reboot the node , once the node is up verify if the set quota remains or not.
#   CEPH-83573406     Test to validate the combination of quota_max_bytes and quota_max_files
#                     Create a FS and create 10 directories and mount them on kernel client and fuse client
#                     Set max bytes quota to a number(say 1Gb) and also set max files quota  and verify if the set
#                     quota limit is working fine by filling max number of files and also by filling data to reach max
#                     limit. Increase the limit to higher number and add data and files again. Repeat this for few more
#                     times.
